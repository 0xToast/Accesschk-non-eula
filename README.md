# accesschk-non-eula
 Older version of accesschk without the GUI “accept EULA” popup window.

The downside is more recent versions of the program spawn a GUI “accept EULA” popup window. When using the command line, we have to use an older version which still has an /accepteula command line option.

I decided to store it here for ease of access.
